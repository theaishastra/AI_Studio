/* Product-detail gallery media helpers.

   An admin can attach a short video to a product alongside its photos (server
   side that's a Media row with media_type="video" - see backend/app/models.py).
   The catalog API deliberately hands videos back in their own `videos` array
   rather than mixing them into `images`, because every other surface in the app
   takes images[0] as a cover and renders it in a plain <img>: cards, heroes, the
   homepage, search results, cart lines, order snapshots. The product detail page
   is the only place with anywhere to play a clip.

   All three detail views (studio's preview modal, corporate's detail modal and
   the gifts product page) were written separately and each has its own gallery
   markup, so what they genuinely share - the ordering rule, the URL sniff and
   the "never leave a clip playing off-screen" rule - lives here rather than
   being written three slightly different ways. */

  /* One ordered [{type, url}] list for a gallery to walk.

     Videos come after the photos on purpose: index 0 is the cover every one of
     these views paints first and uses for its share/OG image, so a clip sitting
     there would open the product on a black frame. An admin who drags a video to
     the front of the list in the panel still gets it second here - that ordering
     controls the photos' order among themselves, which is what it's for. */
